# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

The /javascript/components/GlobalState/Store.js contains the initial state. Because the search functionality does not currently work, nor can you add things directly to the vine list, it is best to update the arrays in the initial state with some numbers to generate the components. As long as it is an array of numbers, the site should work and display that many search results/selected vines.
